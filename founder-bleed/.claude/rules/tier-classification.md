# Tier Classification Rules

## Tiers
- Unique: only the founder can do it
- Founder: a co-founder could do it
- Senior: senior specialist ($100,000/year)
- Junior: junior specialist ($50,000/year)
- EA: executive assistant ($30,000/year)

## Solo Founder Rule
- If team_composition.founder === 1, hide Founder tier
- Any Founder-classified work should be treated as Unique
